# sync-two-caldera-datepickers-back-and-forth
A booking form in Caldera Forms needs a minimum stay of three days
Since I don't understand jquery, I just added the code two times, the second time with the reversed parameters. It seems to work though.
Of course, the two codes could be integrated in one file, but I don't know how.
Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers
